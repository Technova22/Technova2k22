Engineering/Science students are involved in different projects at different points of their engineering/science life. These project plays an important role in shaping the career of a student. The student applies their learning of engineering/science for developing a practical and innovative model Deenbandhu Chhotu Ram University of Science and Technology. Murthal is going to organize a \"Project Expo\" on the day of Technova [the technical fest of the university). The goal of this project expo is to provide a platform to the students to show their knowledge and skills, to motivate the future generations of engineers to be innovative and problem solver and to develop interest of the upcoming generation toward science and engineering. This will be a plethora of knowledge for all the technocrats out there. This year's whole new edition of the exhibition is going to be a perfect blend of innovation and eloquence. Entries for all the engineering/science branches are open. The engineering/science students will be presenting their projects of their particular domain and hence every inquisitive mind is welcomed to solicit their opinions and ideas on the projects.",

      "<li>The blocks should be stacked in threes and each alternate story is laid in cross ways direction so, for example, if the blocks in the first level lie lengthwise in a north-south direction, the second level blocks should be positioned so that they lie east-west and so on, until the last block is laid on the 19th level</li>"+
